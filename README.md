# SwiftCollections-Unity

![SwiftCollections Icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrdav30/SwiftCollections/main/icon.png)

**SwiftCollections** is a Unity package that provides high-performance, memory-efficient data structures optimized for game development and real-time applications.

This package is a Unity-specific implementation of the [SwiftCollections](https://github.com/mrdav30/SwiftCollections) library.

---

## 🛠️ Key Features

- **Optimized for Performance**: Designed for low time complexity and minimal memory allocations.
- **Versatile Use Cases**: Suitable for data structures in 3D environments and complex spatial queries.
- **Memory-Conscious Data Structures**: Custom allocators and lightweight collections minimize GC pressure.

## ♻️ GameObject Pooling

This package includes a lightweight `GameObject` pool under `Runtime/GameObjectPool`.

### Setup

1. Create a pool asset via **Assets → Create → SwiftCollections → SwiftGameObjectPoolAsset**.
2. Save it as `Resources/SwiftGameObjectPoolAsset.asset` so `SwiftGameObjectPoolManager.Shared` can load it.
3. Add one or more pool entries and configure:
   `Pool Name` — string ID used at runtime.
   `Prefab` — the object to spawn.
   `Budget` — max live instances for that pool.
   `Prewarm` — optionally create the full pool up front.

### Usage

```csharp
using SwiftCollections.Pool;
using UnityEngine;

public class BulletSpawner : MonoBehaviour
{
    private const string BulletPoolId = "Bullet";

    public void Fire(Vector3 position, Quaternion rotation)
    {
        if (!SwiftGameObjectPoolManager.Shared.TryGetObject(BulletPoolId, out GameObject bullet))
            return;

        bullet.transform.SetPositionAndRotation(position, rotation);
        bullet.SetActive(true);
    }

    public void ReturnBullet(GameObject bullet)
    {
        SwiftGameObjectPoolManager.Shared.ReleaseObject(BulletPoolId, bullet);
    }
}
```

`TryGetObject(...)` returns `false` when the pool name is missing or every instance is currently checked out. If you prefer a throwing API, `GetObject(...)` is also available. Both methods return the pooled instance inactive, so configure it and enable it when ready. When you are finished with an instance, return it with `ReleaseObject(...)` so it can be reused.

## 📐 Bounds Helpers

This package includes runtime helpers for converting Unity `Bounds` into SwiftCollections query volumes via `Bounds.ToBoundVolume()`.

For `FixedMathSharp` support, the companion package includes `Bounds.ToFixedBoundVolume()` which converts a Unity `Bounds` into a `FixedBoundVolume` that can be used with the fixed-point spatial queries in SwiftCollections.

## 📦 Sample Scene

This repo includes a complete sample under `Samples/SwiftCollectionsDemo`.

The sample includes:

- `Scenes/DemoScene.unity`
- pooled projectile, target, query volume, and HUD prefabs
- sample scripts under `Samples/SwiftCollectionsDemo/Scripts`
- `Resources/SwiftGameObjectPoolAsset.asset`
- `SampleSceneGuide.md` with setup, tuning, and script notes

The sample demonstrates:

- explicit `GameObject` pooling with graceful exhaustion handling
- `SwiftList`, `SwiftDictionary`, and `SwiftHashSet` in scene runtime state
- `SwiftBVH<int>` broad-phase spatial queries against moving targets
- live switching between `BVH Query` and `Linear Scan`
